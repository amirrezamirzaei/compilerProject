# compilerProject

Final project of "Compiler Design (Instructor: Prof. GholamReza GhassemSani)" course at Sharif University of Technology.
The purpose of this project is to write a compiler for a simplified version of C language. The grammar of this language can be found [here](https://github.com/amirrezamirzaei/compilerProject/blob/main/parsers/grammar.txt).  
our compiler is a one-pass compiler that produces three address code as its output. you can test the compiler by running compiler.py and writing your program in input.txt.
